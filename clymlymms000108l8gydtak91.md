We will learn today  
1\. What is Linux  
2\. Linux File Structure  
3\. what is SSH?  
4\. what is FTP?  
  
Introduction to Linux:  
Linux is an operating system, like Windows or macOS, that runs on computers, servers, smartphones, and many other devices. It’s the software that manages the hardware and allows other programs to run.

* **Open Source**: One of the key features of Linux is that it's open source, which means anyone can look at the code, modify it, and share it freely. This has led to a large community of developers who contribute to its improvement.
    
* **Free to Use**: Unlike some other operating systems, Linux is usually free to download and use.
    

**Who Developed Linux and When**:

* **Developer**: Linux was created by **<mark>Linus Torvalds</mark>**, a Finnish software engineer.
    
* **When**: Linus started developing Linux in 1991 while he was a student at the University of Helsinki.
    

Today, Linux is maintained by a large community of developers from around the world and is used in various forms for a wide range of applications, from personal computers to large servers and even smartphones (like Android).

**<mark>Let's take a journey into SSH - Secure Shell</mark>**

SSH (Secure Shell) is a way to securely connect to another computer over the internet. It’s like a private, encrypted tunnel that lets you control and manage a remote computer as if you were sitting right in front of it. Here’s a simple breakdown:

* **Secure Connection**: SSH encrypts the data sent between your computer and the remote computer, making sure no one else can see or tamper with it.
    
* **Remote Access**: With SSH, you can log into another computer from anywhere, run commands, move files, and manage the system.
    
* **Safety**: It's designed to be secure, preventing unauthorized access and keeping your data safe.
    

So, SSH is a tool that lets you safely connect to another computer from a distance, commonly used by IT professionals and developers.

The most common SSH tools we use are  
1\. Putty  
2\. Super Putty  
3\. Mobaxterm  
Throughout the sessions, we will be using Mobaxterm as an SSH tool you can go ahead and explore the other tools as well( check out the below video to know more)

**<mark>FTP: File Transfer Protocol</mark>**  
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a simple way to move files between computers over the internet. Here’s an easy way to understand it:

* **Sending Files**: Imagine you have a bunch of photos on your computer that you want to send to a friend. FTP is like a digital delivery service that lets you upload these photos to a shared space where your friend can download them.
    
* **Receiving Files**: Similarly, if your friend wants to send you some files, they can upload them to this shared space, and you can download them to your computer.

In essence, FTP is a method to upload and download files between your computer and another computer or server, making it easier to share large files over the internet.  
The most popular tools of FTP are  
1\. Winscp (windows Secure runs only on Windows OS)  
2\. FileZilla( runs on Mac and Windows)  
3\. CyberDuck  
  
in our Practical sessions, we will learn about FileZilla which is popular and supports Windows and Mac OS  
On day 2 we will learn more practical approaches of SSH and FTP we will install and play around with the SSH and FTP and then dive deep into Linux covering essential skills required for DevOps  
  
**<mark>See you all soon on Day 2</mark>**
