### Today we will understand

What is AWS ?  
What is Cloud Computing & AWS?  
Companies that use AWS? and  
Popular Services on AWS?

1. what is AWS?  
    AWS, or Amazon Web Services, is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. Imagine you have a bunch of tools and resources (like servers, databases, and storage) that you can access over the internet whenever you need them, rather than having to buy and maintain all those tools yourself.
    
    For example, let's say you have a small business and you need a website. Instead of buying and managing your own servers to host the website, you can use AWS. AWS provides servers (called EC2 instances) where you can run your website, databases (like Amazon RDS) to store your data securely, and even a content delivery network (like Amazon CloudFront) to make your website load faster for users around the world.
    
    In simple terms, AWS is like renting a toolbox with all the tools you need to build and run your projects, rather than owning and storing those tools yourself. It's flexible, scalable, and cost-effective, making it popular for businesses of all sizes.
    
2. What is Cloud Computing & AWS?  
    Cloud computing is like using someone else's computer over the internet to do your work, store your files, or run your applications. Instead of owning and maintaining your own computer hardware, you can rent space and computing power from a cloud provider.
    
    For example, imagine you're a photographer. Instead of buying and managing a powerful computer to edit your photos, you can use a cloud service like AWS (Amazon Web Services). AWS offers virtual computers (called instances) that you can rent by the hour. You upload your photos to AWS, use their powerful computers to edit them using software like Adobe Photoshop, and then download the edited photos back to your own computer.
    
    In this scenario, AWS acts as your virtual computer lab, providing the tools and resources you need without you having to worry about the underlying hardware or maintenance costs. It's flexible, scalable (meaning you can easily increase or decrease your resources as needed), and cost-effective, making it a popular choice for individuals and businesses alike.
    
3. Companies that use AWS?  
    Many companies across various industries use AWS (Amazon Web Services) for their cloud computing needs. Here are some examples:

4. Popular Services on AWS?  
    AWS (Amazon Web Services) offers a wide range of cloud computing services to cater to diverse needs across industries. Some of the popular services provided by AWS include:
    
    1. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Virtual servers (instances) that allow you to run applications and services in the cloud,  
        It is all about having access to another computer, where many websites and applications can be hosted, but real magic is you can scale up and down your computing owner as required .
